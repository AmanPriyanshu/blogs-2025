Buckle up as we embark on a journey through the linguistic forests of Y-Combinator pitches!\nThe Seed of an Idea Picture this: It’s 2 AM, I’m knee-deep in YC application videos, and suddenly it hits me – what if startup pitches are like trees? 🤔 Each word a branch, each phrase a limb, growing into this complex organism we call a pitch. That’s when YC-Dendrolinguistics was born, my wild attempt to map the DNA of startup communication.\nCultivating the Startup Vocabulary So, what exactly am I doing? Well, imagine if David Attenborough decided to narrate a nature documentary about startup pitches instead of penguins. That’s basically me, minus the soothing accent. I’m analyzing YC startup descriptions, breaking them down to their roots, and seeing what kind of linguistic forest they create.\nHere’s what’s growing in our little experiment:\nPitch Decomposition: Slicing and dicing startup pitches into their fundamental components. It’s like linguistic bonsai, but with more buzzwords. Grammar Trees: Creating tree structures that represent pitch patterns. Theme Spotting: Hunting for common elements across pitches. Data Visualization: Turning all this linguistic madness into pretty graphs. Because nothing says “I understand startups” like a forest of colorful scatterplots. The YC-Dendrolinguistics Toolkit Startup Similarity Search: Your Personal Pitch Compass (Now with Extra Privacy!) Remember that time you tried to explain your startup idea and accidentally described a toaster? Well, fear not! I’ve built a similarity search tool that lets you explore how different startups describe themselves.\nBut here’s the kicker – I’ve gone full-on privacy nerd with this one. 🕵️‍♂️ I’ve created an on-prem, user-browser live semantic search that runs entirely within static GitHub pages. That’s right, we’re bringing the power of semantic search right to your browser, no server required!\nHow does it work? Well, I download a huggingface local model onto your browser, and you do all the computing right there on your machine (Also if you do wanna deep dive into my other LLM safety work, you can check out the fractured response blog, on decomposing malicious intent questions and jailbreaking LLMs). It’s like having a mini AI assistant camping out in your browser tabs. No need to worry about your brilliant startup ideas being sent off to some mysterious cloud server. Your searches stay between you, your computer, and the linguistic forest we’re growing together.\nInteractive Scatterplots: Where Pitches Go to Party Picture a disco, but instead of people, it’s startup pitches dancing around. That’s essentially what my interactive scatterplots look like. Each colorful dot represents a different aspect of a startup pitch. It’s part data visualization, part modern art, hopefully addictive to play with.\nProbability Trees: Sentence Diagrams on Steroids Remember those sentence diagrams from school that made you question your life choices? I’ve resurrected them, gave them an AI makeover, and set them loose on startup pitches. The result? Probability trees that show how different parts of a pitch tend to branch out. It’s part linguistics, part data science, and entirely too much fun to be considered work.\nWhy Am I Doing This? Good question! Part of me wants to say it’s for the greater good of startup-kind. But let’s be real – I’m doing this because it’s absolutely fascinating. It’s like being a linguistic Nathan Drake, only instead of ancient treasures, I’m uncovering the hidden patterns in how we talk about innovation.\nBut hey, if this project ends up:\nHelping a few aspiring entrepreneurs craft pitches Giving investors a new lens to view startup trends Or just providing some entertainment for fellow language and startup nerds Then I’ll consider it a success. And if not, well, at least I’ll have some pretty cool graphs to show.\nWhat’s Next in Our Linguistic Forest? Who knows? Maybe we’ll discover the startup pitch equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster. Or perhaps we’ll find that one magical phrase that guarantees funding (spoiler: it probably doesn’t exist, but we can dream).\nIn all seriousness, this project is as much about the journey as it is about the destination. I’m learning new things every day, and I’m excited to see where this trail of linguistic breadcrumbs leads us.\nGot ideas? Suggestions? Want to geek out about grammar trees or startup lingo? Drop me a line! My inbox is always open.\nP.S. If you found this dive into the startup linguistic forest intriguing (or at least mildly entertaining), stay tuned! There’s plenty more where this came from. And hey, if you want to collaborate on some wild AI-meets-startup experiment, don’t hesitate to reach out.

<p>Remember that time you tried to explain your startup idea and accidentally described a toaster? Well, fear not! I&rsquo;ve built a <a href="https://amanpriyanshu.github.io/YC-Dendrolinguistics">similarity search tool</a> that lets you explore how different startups describe themselves.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the kicker – I&rsquo;ve gone full-on privacy nerd with this one. 🕵️‍♂️ I&rsquo;ve created an on-prem, user-browser live semantic search that runs entirely within static GitHub pages. That&rsquo;s right, we&rsquo;re bringing the power of semantic search right to your browser, no server required!</p>
<p>How does it work? Well, I download a huggingface local model onto your browser, and you do all the computing right there on your machine (<em>Also if you do wanna deep dive into my other LLM safety work, you can check out the <a href="https://amanpriyanshu.github.io/blogs/posts/2024/fractured-sorry-bench/">fractured response blog, on decomposing malicious intent questions and jailbreaking LLMs</a></em>). It&rsquo;s like having a mini AI assistant camping out in your browser tabs. No need to worry about your brilliant startup ideas being sent off to some mysterious cloud server. Your searches stay between you, your computer, and the linguistic forest we&rsquo;re growing together.</p>

<p>Picture a disco, but instead of people, it&rsquo;s startup pitches dancing around. That&rsquo;s essentially what my <a href="https://amanpriyanshu.github.io/YC-Dendrolinguistics/graphs.html">interactive scatterplots</a> look like. Each colorful dot represents a different aspect of a startup pitch. It&rsquo;s part data visualization, part modern art, hopefully addictive to play with.</p>

<p>Remember those sentence diagrams from school that made you question your life choices? I&rsquo;ve resurrected them, gave them an AI makeover, and set them loose on startup pitches. The result? <a href="https://amanpriyanshu.github.io/YC-Dendrolinguistics/proba_pages.html">Probability trees</a> that show how different parts of a pitch tend to branch out. It&rsquo;s part linguistics, part data science, and entirely too much fun to be considered work.</p>
<h2 id="why-am-i-doing-this">Why Am I Doing This?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-am-i-doing-this">#</a></h2>
<p>Good question! Part of me wants to say it&rsquo;s for the greater good of startup-kind. But let&rsquo;s be real – I&rsquo;m doing this because it&rsquo;s absolutely fascinating. It&rsquo;s like being a linguistic Nathan Drake, only instead of ancient treasures, I&rsquo;m uncovering the hidden patterns in how we talk about innovation.</p>
<p>But hey, if this project ends up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping a few aspiring entrepreneurs craft pitches</li>
<li>Giving investors a new lens to view startup trends</li>
<li>Or just providing some entertainment for fellow language and startup nerds</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll consider it a success. And if not, well, at least I&rsquo;ll have some pretty cool graphs to show.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next-in-our-linguistic-forest">What&rsquo;s Next in Our Linguistic Forest?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#whats-next-in-our-linguistic-forest">#</a></h2>
<p>Who knows? Maybe we&rsquo;ll discover the startup pitch equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster. Or perhaps we&rsquo;ll find that one magical phrase that guarantees funding (spoiler: it probably doesn&rsquo;t exist, but we can dream).</p>
<p>In all seriousness, this project is as much about the journey as it is about the destination. I&rsquo;m learning new things every day, and I&rsquo;m excited to see where this trail of linguistic breadcrumbs leads us.</p>
<p>Got ideas? Suggestions? Want to geek out about grammar trees or startup lingo? Drop me a line! My inbox is always open.</p>

<p><em>P.S. If you found this dive into the startup linguistic forest intriguing (or at least mildly entertaining), stay tuned! There&rsquo;s plenty more where this came from. And hey, if you want to collaborate on some wild AI-meets-startup experiment, don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out. My email is still amanpriyanshusms2001[at]gmail[dot]com. Let&rsquo;s grow this forest together!</em> 🌱🤖📊</p>
